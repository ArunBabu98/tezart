# Quick start

## Use this package as a dart library 

1. Depend on it 

Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```dart

```

2. Install it

You can install packages from the command line:

with pub:

```sh 
$ dart pub get
```

Alternatively, your editor might support dart pub get or flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

import 'package:tezart/tezart.dart';
```
